### Step 1: Setup the MCP server with Cursor

Go to Cursor preferences and click to add an MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Prismic MCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@prismicio/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Test `how-to-code-slice` tool

In Cursor chat:

1. Select "Agent" mode
2. Select "claude-3.7-sonnet" model
3. Add your empty slice file in the chat context (`CMD+i` from the slice file)
4. Write in the chat `Code this slice`
5. Execute the command
6. When the tool is called by Cursor, accept it by clicking on "Run tool"

ðŸš€ And Cursor will generate the slice for you.

_You can also ask Cursor to help you on specific fields inside the slice._
